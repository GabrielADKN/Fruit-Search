# Fruit-Search

In this project, I will plan and build an Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit. When I type anything into Google, a drop down appears with suggestions for what I may want to search for. If I click on one of these suggestions, it populates the search bar with that suggestion.

Building search bars like this is a common task for front-end engineers. I will be building a small-scale search bar which suggests various fruits based on user input. The project will provide a list of fruits and a mock-up of how the page should look. I will handle the rest. If a user's typed input is contained anywhere in one of the fruits in the list, then a drop down will appear containing all the fruits which match. As the user continues to add letters to their input, new dropdowns will populate. When a user clicks on one of these options, it will populate in the search bar.
